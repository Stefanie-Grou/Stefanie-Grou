## 🌎 <b> About me </b>
💻 Data Science and Software Engineering Student | UNIVESP

📍 São Paulo - SP - Brazil.  

I’m currently transitioning from a LIMS consultant to a Back-End Developer, focusing on Java. With strong skills in SQL, Python, and process automation, I'm eager to apply my technical abilities to new challenges in software development. My GitHub showcases the projects I'm working on as I build my proficiency in Java and back-end technologies.
